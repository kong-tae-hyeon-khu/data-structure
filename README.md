2. Sorted List 
3. Stack
----------------------------------------    
#### Unsorted List
Unsorted List : No Rule between elements that is, elements are saved in list according to time. it is efficient when data is saved but inefficient when we find certain element because there are no rules between elements.    
    

#### Sorted List
Sorted List : Rule between elements exists, So elements are saved according to rule. Saving elements is more complexity than Unsorted List. But if we find certain element, we find the element more faster than Unsorted List.    
    
    
#### Stack    
Stack : LIFO (Last-in, First-out) that is , If 'A' is inserted in Stack , and 'B' is inserted in Stack , we have to take out 'A' first in order to take out 'B'.
